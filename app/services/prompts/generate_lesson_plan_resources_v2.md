### Design a Lesson Plan for the following:

- **Grade:** {{grades}}
- **Subject:** {{subject}}
- **Topic/Chapter Name:** {{topic}}
- **Translation:** {{translation}}

---

### Step 1. Determine Paired Grade-Level Topics from Official Textbooks:

- First, analyze the **core concept** of the provided **Starting Grade & Topic**.
- Based on the **Starting Grade**, find the corresponding chapter titles for the other grade(s) from the official textbook index (e.g., _'Balbharati Mathematics textbook index'_). The pairing will follow this logic:

  - If a **Grade 1** topic is provided, find the **progressive skill** in the **Grade 2** textbook.
  - If a **Grade 2** topic is provided, find the **foundational skill** in the **Grade 1** textbook.
  - If a **Grade 3** topic is provided, find the **progressive skills** in **BOTH** the **Grade 4** and **Grade 5** textbooks.
  - If a **Grade 4** topic is provided, find the **related skills** in **BOTH** the **Grade 3** and **Grade 5** textbooks.
  - If a **Grade 5** topic is provided, find the **related skills** in **BOTH** the **Grade 3** and **Grade 4** textbooks.

- You must use the **exact chapter titles** from the textbook index for all topics.

Step 1A. Student Grouping by Learning Level
Review the provided learning levels for each student.

Sort and assign students into three instructional groups. If the selected Subject is Maths (regardless of medium), base the groups on the “Maths Learning Level”. For all other subjects, base the groups on the “Language Learning Level”.

Beginner Group: Students marked as 'Beginner' (focus on building foundational concepts one at a time)

Intermediate Group: Students marked as 'Intermediate' (focus on applying and connecting simple concepts)

Advanced Group: Students marked as 'Advanced' (focus on combining concepts and tackling challenging, creative tasks)

When designing all 'Differentiated Practice' and 'Targeted Activities', clearly label them for each group and ensure group membership is based on the latest {{subject}} learning levels.

For every lesson component (introductions, group activities, wrap-ups), incorporate differentiated instructions, supports, and expectations according to these established groups.

### Step 2. Identify a Common Theme

Based on the paired topics (two or three grades), identify a **single, unifying theme** for the lesson.

---

### Step 3. Create Differentiated Objectives

Write separate, **clear learning objectives** for what students in **each grade level** should be able to do by the end of the lesson.  

---

## A. Lesson Plan Structure

The plan must follow this specific structure and include the following elements **in detail**:

- **Combined Hook:** An initial activity that engages **all grades together** under the common theme. (Attention-grabbing, relatable to children)

- **Shared Introduction:** A core teaching segment that introduces the concepts **sequentially**, building from the simplest to the most complex.

- **Differentiated Group Activities:** Design **distinct activities** for each grade level.

- **Shared Wrap-up and Evaluation:** A concluding activity to **quickly assess all grades** on their respective objectives.

### Learning Objectives (in simple {{medium}})

---

### Prior Knowledge Questions
(5 short, interesting checks with answer keys)

---

### Keywords and Key Ideas

---

### What Matters Most
(Core concept of the lesson)

---

### Teacher Script for Direct Instruction
(Detailed)

---

### Common Misconceptions Table
(With strategies to correct them)

---

### Think-Pair-Share Activity
(Engaging, age-appropriate)

---

### Check For Understanding (CFU)
Questions with answer keys

---

### Differentiated Practice
_Easy / Medium / Hard_

---

### Exit Ticket Question

---

## B. Differentiated Targeted Activities (Mandatory)

- Based on the provided **student learning levels**, design **distinct 10-minute activities** for:
  - **Beginner**
  - **Intermediate**
  - **Advanced** groups

- **Key Principle:**
  - For the **Beginner** group, ensure activities teach **one concept at a time**.
  - For the **Advanced** group, the activity should **challenge them to combine concepts creatively**

---

## C. Additional Support Materials
(Include as attachments or detailed in the response)
**Keep it Practical:** Ensure the materials needed are **simple** and the activities are **suitable for a standard classroom environment.**

- A **short song or jingle** to help kids remember the topic
- A **memory story** that simplifies the core idea using characters or a situation
- **2–3 relevant YouTube video links** for visual reinforcement
- A **one-page parent note in {{medium}}** explaining what was taught and how they can support at home
- A **teacher preparation reading note** in listicle format (5–7 points) to help understand the topic before entering the class

---

## D. Pedagogical Alignment

- Follow **Gradual Release of Responsibility** (`I Do, We Do, You Do`)
- Include **Teach Like A Champion strategies** where suitable (**label them**)
- Keep in mind that:
  - Students are **first-generation {{medium}} learners**
  - Students are **1 level below grade** in comprehension
- Keep **language simple**, **instructions clear**, and **activities engaging**</pre>
